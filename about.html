                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p> We are a group of friends that have been living and surfing together on Ballybunion beach for
                    over ten years.In 2022, after a long break from socialising, we met up for our first surf after the
                    covid
                    pandemic.</p>
                <p>We have noticed a lot of plastic debris washing up at the beach; especially surgical masks and
                    plastic capsules. We have always been passionate about our environments and the beaches, thus we
                    came up with the
                    Coast Keepers initiative.</p>
                <p>We also want to encourage people to start engaging with local community again while
                    cleaning up our beautiful North Kerry beaches and learning about the harm of coastal
                    pollution.</p>

                <h2> Why is coast cleaning so important?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>There are many causes of the degradation of marine ecology: humans pollute beaches with various
                    single use plastics, fishing gear, surgical masks etc. Also, marine debries
                    consisting of plastic and chemical polutants are carried from all over the world and accumulate on
                    beaches. This often leads to environmental degradation
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    These pollutants harm marine life, ecology, human health, and coastal tourism

                        <h3>Public Health</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Polluted beaches can harm human lives; many items such as broken glasses, sharp metals, or
                            hard plastics may injure beach-goers physically. Plastic and chemical polutants can
                            contaminate the water, exposure to which can lead to health issues.

                        <hr>
                        <p>Beach litter poses dangers to wildlife on the beaches and marine ecology. Many beach
                            pollutants such as fishing gears and nets harm sea animals including sea turtles and
                            seabirds, and can cause serious injuries or death if the animal gets trapped in them.</p>

                        <p>Clean beaches are indicators of the environmental quality.Trash on the beach, if left
                            untouched, can make it's way into the waterways;by cleaning it
                            from our coasts we prevent harmful pollutants from entering the marine environment.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>.Ecosystems on our coasts are very intricate and disruption to their delicate systems is
                            detrimental to their welbeeing.Cleaning
                            beaches from trash is vital to keeping the balance of marine biodiversity and ensuring the
                            survival and helth of local ecosystems and species.</p>

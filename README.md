## **Exploration Phase:**
In this decade we can observe increased desire in people in Ireland to care for their local environment. As part of our research, when talking to residents of coastal towns in county Kerry, the common topic of conversation often is the cleanliness of our local waterways and what can local community do to prevent water pollution. 
What is the first step?

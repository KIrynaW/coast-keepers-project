## **Exploration Phase:**
In this decade we can observe increased desire in people in Ireland to care for their local environment. As part of our research, when talking to residents of coastal towns in county Kerry, the common topic of conversation often is the cleanliness of our local waterways and what can local community do to prevent water pollution. 
What is the first step? 
Starting a website to educate and bring people together localy to help this environmental cause was the common answer.

Jackie, Listowel, Co. Kerry:

> *I want to be able to go online and find a local group that I can join for environmental events, clean-ups and social engagement without going  Facebook. I love our environment and I want to learn more about how I can help.*

Mairead, Ballyheigue, Co. Kerry:

> *During Covid, we were all locked up and using masks and all sorts of plastic medical items, without thinking about how it affects our environment. Now, when I walk my dog at the beach, I see masks washed up and I want to gather as a community and start cleaning it all, but I don't know where to start.*

John, Ballylongford, Co. Kerry:

> *I love our Kerry coasts and I enjoy surfing once in awhile. All I hear now is how microplastic is in everything and it really bothers me. I want to help somehow and join a group where we can learn and improve our local environment together.*

Deirdre, Community Development Officer, Banna, Co.Kerry:

> *One of the aims of my job is to develop and encourage meaningful community engagement events. My organisation have been discussing importanse of our coastal environment. We would benefit from collaborating with any local environment groups and their events. Where can we find them?*

  - Set up a Cloud database where all the feedback forms would be sent.

  - A live chat section where like minded environmentalists can talk.

   

## **Testing Phase:**
The testing and validation of the code was performed throughout the website creation, and overall no major issues were detected:
  - At first we will look at the issues and bugs encounteredat the final stages of the project completion and how they were fixed. 
  - Then we will look at how the website performs once all issues were cleared.

### **Bugs**
Here are the key issues detected at the final stages of website completion and how they were fixed:
  - The website was run through [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) web accessibility evaluation tool, and few errors were found.

     - __Error 1: Form Label__
     - The issue was in the missing value in the *label* property.

        ![First Error found in the html code](docs/readme-images/error1-formlabel.jpg)

        - **Solution:** a *h2* with hidden-text *class* was created which then styled in stylesheets to apear hidden.

           ![First Error solution code](docs/readme-images/error1-initialfix.jpg)
           ![Hidden text solution CSS code](docs/readme-images/hidden-text.jpg)
       
     - __Error 2: Fully Justified Text__
      
        ![Second Error found in the html code](docs/readme-images/error2.jpg)

        - **Solution:** To wrap the *img* in a *div*.
        
           ![Second error solution code](docs/readme-images/error2-fix.jpg)

     - __Error 3: Missing Fieldset__

        ![Third Error found in the html code](docs/readme-images/error3.jpg)

        - **Solution** Wrap the *label* and *input* in *fieldset* and use *legend*s.

           ![Third error solution code](docs/readme-images/error3-fix.jpg)

- The website was then run through the [W3C Markup Validation Tool](https://validator.w3.org/)
     - The *Index* page did not show any issue but the *About*, *Schedule*, *Sign Up* and *Submit-feedback* all showed the same errors:

        ![Two same errors across three website pages](docs/readme-images/error1-error4-validator.jpg)

     - The first error was the same one that was highlighted by *Wave* evalutation tool, but the solution cleared the error in *Wave* but not in the *W3C Validator*.   
     - The error  was resolved by placing **span** instead of the **h2** element, as it does not get recognised as an error becuase of its properties.

        ![Final solution for the first error](docs/readme-images/error1-finalsolution.jpg)

     - The fourth error, of the total error order, was a simple misplacement of the embedded *Font Awesome* Icon Kit.
     - It was fixed by wrapping in in the **body** section, as it was outside wrapped in *html* element.

        ![Fourth error code fix](docs/readme-images/error4-fix.jpg)

     - The final, fifth error encoutered was when Manual Testing on *Google Chrome* and *Microsoft Edge* by using dev tool option.
     - All pages but, the *Index* page were clear of errors.
     - This error was hard to identify.

        ![Fifth error in Chrome dev tool](docs/readme-images/error5.jpg)
  
     - The different sections of .html and .css code was isolated and tested to pinpoint the issue, with no result.

        ![Error Five source of issue removed](docs/readme-images/error5-removevid.jpg)

        ![Fifth error code in html](docs/readme-images/error5-code.jpg)

- It was later discovered that it was a third party code error in the YouTube video source that was showing up, as when the embeded video link was removed, the error cleared.
- No further action was required.

### **Validator Testing**  

Once all the Bugs were cleared the website was evaluated by [W3C Markup Validation Tool](https://validator.w3.org/) and [Jigsaw: CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

All Website Pages and CSS Style Sheet was clear of errors.
  - Index/Home Page:

     ![Website Index Page validated](docs/readme-images/indexpage-validated.jpg)

  - About Page:

     ![Website About Page validated](docs/readme-images/aboutpage-validated.jpg)

  - Schedule Page:

     ![Website Schedule Page validated](docs/readme-images/schedulepage-validated.jpg)

  - Sign Up Page:

     ![Website Sign Up Page validated](docs/readme-images/signuppage-validated.jpg)

  - Submit Feedback Page:

     ![Website Submit Feedback Page validated](docs/readme-images/submitfeedback-validated.jpg)

  - CSS Style Sheet:

     ![CSS Style Sheet Validates](docs/readme-images/css-validated.jpg) 


### **Accessibility Testing:**
To check the website *Performance*, *Accessibility*, *Best Practice* and *SEO*, the website was run through the *Lighthouse* Chrome Dev Tools performance statistics generator.

- A low performance was noticed in the general website and *Index* page perforance statistic.
- It was deduced that the reason for reduced performance was the embeded YouTube video in the *Index* page.
  - Desktop:

     ![General Website Lighthouse statistic generated with YouTube video inluded - Desktop](docs/readme-images/general-desktop.jpg)&nbsp;&nbsp;
     ![Index Page Lighthouse statistic generated with YouTube video included - Desktop](docs/readme-images/index-desktop.jpg)

  - Mobile:

     ![General Website Lighthouse statistic generated with YouTube video inluded - Phone](docs/readme-images/general-mobile.jpg)&nbsp;&nbsp;
     ![Index Page Lighthouse statistic generated with YouTube video included - Phone](docs/readme-images/index-mobile.jpg)

- For testing purpouse, the video was removed and Lihthouse report was generated again and the performance was improved.
   
  - Desktop:

     ![General Website Lighthouse statistic generated without the YouTube video - Desktop](docs/readme-images/general-desktop-novid.jpg)

  - Mobile:

     ![General Website Lighthouse statistic generated without the YouTube video - Phone](docs/readme-images/general-mobile-novid.jpg)

Despite the performance being reduced, the decision was made to keep the embeded YouTube video, as it added value to the website.

The *About*, *Schedule* and *Sign Up* page were also run through *Lighthouse* statistic generator and scored high.
  - Desktop:
     - *About Page:*

        ![Lighthouse statistic generated on About page - desktop](docs/readme-images/about-desktop.jpg)

## **Exploration Phase:**
In this decade we can observe increased desire in people in Ireland to care for their local environment. As part of our research, when talking to residents of coastal towns in county Kerry, the common topic of conversation often is the cleanliness of our local waterways and what can local community do to prevent water pollution. 
What is the first step? 
Starting a website to educate and bring people together localy to help this environmental cause was the common answer.

Jackie, Listowel, Co. Kerry:
> I want to be able to go online and find a local group that I can join for environmental events, clean-ups and social engagement without going  Facebook. I love our environment and I want to learn more about how I can help.

Mairead, Ballyheigue, Co. Kerry:
>During Covid, we were all locked up and using masks and all sorts of plastic medical items, without thinking about how it affects our environment. Now, when I walk my dog at the beach, I see masks washed up and I want to gather as a community and start cleaning it all, but I don't know where to start.

John, Ballylongford, Co. Kerry:
> I love our Kerry coasts and I enjoy surfing once in awhile. All I hear now is how microplastic is in everything and it really bothers me. I want to help somehow and join a group where we can learn and improve our local environment together.

Deirdre, Community Development Officer, Banna, Co.Kerry:
> One of the aims of my job is to develop and encourage meaningful community engagement events. My organisation have been discussing importanse of our coastal environment. We would benefit from collaborating with any local environment groups and their events. Where can we find them?
